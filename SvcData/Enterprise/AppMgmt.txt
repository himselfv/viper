# Application Management
Processes requests to enumerate, install and remove applications that are deployed through the organization via Group Policy.

"Control Panel > Get Programs" uses this to retrieve the list of deployed applications on the network.

Opportunistically called on any application removal, or when a component (such as the shell) makes an installation request for an application to handle a file name extension, Component Object Model (COM) class, or ProgID that is not present on the computer.

Manual by default. Started automatically on first demand. Does not stop after it is started.

DISABLE: Users cannot install, remove, or enumerate applications that are deployed in AD DS. Otherwise fine.
