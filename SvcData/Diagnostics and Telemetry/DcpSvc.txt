Data Collection and Publishing / Crowdsourcing Service
TELEMETRY

> The DCP (Data Collection and Publishing) service supports first party apps to upload data to cloud.

Seems to be related to Windows Phone and "crowdsourcing", telemetry. Contains URLs below.

In dcpsvc.dll:
> Windows Phone Crowdsourcing Data Loader
> X-WPS-Partner-StatusCode, X-WPS-DeviceID:, X-WPS-Partner-StatusMessage, Content-Encoding: gzip, X-WPS-LiveID:, X-WPS-Crowdsource
> https://dcpservice.windowsphone.com
> https://dcp-pn.dcpservice.windowsphone-int.com/
> dcp.windowsphone.net
> PhoneMobileOperatorName,
> Microsoft.Windows.Telemetry.DataCollectionAndPublish
> Microsoft-Windows-DataCollectionServiceChannel

Seems to have been called "CrowdsourcingService" before, as all functions start with that.

RESUME: Probably better off disabled and/or deleted. Looks like a remnant from something deprecated.
