# User Experience Virtualization Service
Monitors registered applications and the operating system for any settings changes, then synchronizes those settings between computers.

UEV is a facility for enterprise setting sync, something like partial Roaming profiles.

Settings form various places (AppData, Registry) are grouped into packages by application, then stored on a network share.

Settings for Desktop applications are synchronized on app exit, Windows settings on logout.

UE-V uses XML files as settings location templates to monitor and synchronize desktop application settings and Windows desktop settings between computers. By default, some settings location templates are included in UE-V.

You can also create, edit, or validate custom settings location templates by managing settings synchronization for custom applications.
WinRT apps do not need these templates.
