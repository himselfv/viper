Service properties and where to find them
There are two ways to access services: through SCM API and through Registry. This document lists all known service properties and how to access them both ways.

BASIC INFO
QueryServiceConfig() / ChangeServiceConfig():
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winsvc/ns-winsvc-_query_service_configa

SCM param		Type		Registry param
  ServiceType		DWORD		Type					Normal SERVICE_TYPE enum + SERVICE_INTERACTIVE_PROCESS
  StartType		DWORD		Start
  ErrorControl		DWORD		ErrorControl				IGNORE/NORMAL/SEVERE/CRITICAL -- see QueryServiceConfig docs
  BinaryPathName	string		ImagePath
  LoadOrderGroup	string		Group
  TagId			DWORD		Tag					Only used for drivers
  Dependencies		string		DependOnService, DependOnGroup
  ServiceStartName	string		ObjectName				User name with which to start the service
  Password		string		?					Password for the above user (empty for system accounts)
  DisplayName		string		DisplayName

For svchost-based services, in either / or /Parameters:
					ServiceDll
				    	ServiceDllUnloadOnStop
    					ServiceMain
Svchost-based services should be SERVICE_WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS, normal ones - SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS.


EXTENDED INFO
QueryServiceConfig2() / ChangeServiceConfig2()

SERVICE_CONFIG_DESCRIPTION:
  Description		string		Description

SERVICE_CONFIG_FAILURE_ACTIONS:
    SERVICE_FAILURE_ACTIONS
      dwResetPeriod       dword
      lpRebootMsg         string      RebootMessage
      lpCommand           string      FailureCommand
      cActions            dword
      lpsaActions         LPSC_ACTION
      SC_ACTION
        Type_: SC_ACTION_TYPE;
        Delay: DWORD;
  FailureActions: 40 bytes
  I think this is a SERVICE_FAILURE_ACTIONS + 3xSC_ACTION together, with dynamic
  fields simply containing trash.
    ResetPeriod           dword       reset the failure counter after %1 ms
    trash?                dword
    trash?                dword
    trash? 03 00 00 00    dword
    trash? 14 00 00 00    dword       maybe offset of the first SC_ACTION from the start?
    3x
      Type                dword       SC_ACTION_TYPE
      Delay               dword       delay in ms
    MMC Services Snap-in only shows one "delay" that's applied to all 3 cases, but
    until you edit them, many services actually have different times (e.g. 2+3).
    If any of the actions is "Reboot", they all get the "delay before reboot" set
    in the additional windows.

  SERVICE_CONFIG_FAILURE_ACTIONS_FLAG:
    SERVICE_FAILURE_ACTIONS_FLAG
    fFailureActionsOnNonCrashFailures   Bool    FailureActionsOnNonCrashFailures
      That's the checkbox under the normal failure actions in the MMC Snap-In.
  }
    FailureActions: TByteArray; //binary, 40 bytes. Last 4 bytes seems to be a timeout for something (e.g. 60000)
    FailureCommand: string; //single-string, command
    FailureActionsOnNonCrashFailures: boolean; //dword_bool
    RebootMessage: string;

SERVICE_CONFIG_SERVICE_SID_INFO (SERVICE_SID_INFO):
