Enables the computer to participate in the election for maintaining the browser list.

The browser list contains all computers, that have announced themselves on the network through the Server service

    Home Network: This service only need to be activated on a single computer. It is convenient to activate this service on all computers to avoid single point of failure.
    Corporate Network: The Active Directory should be used instead.

Note even if no computer is maintaining the browser list, then it is still possible to access remote shares by creating direct shortcuts or mapping network shares (\\computername\sharename).

Note the Computer Browser service will fail to start if the services it depends on are not available (Disable the Computer Browser if not using File Sharing):

    Event ID: 7003
