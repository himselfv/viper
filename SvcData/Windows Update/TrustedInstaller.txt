# Trusted Installer

Required to install or uninstall any updates (CBS components, assemblies), including
* those delivered through Windows Update or manually
* as CAB or as EXE
* or via MSI
* standalone language packs (MUI)
* also required for uninstallation

Can be safely stopped when you're not installing/uninstalling things. Various software will give cryptic errors when it is disabled, but otherwise it's fine to only enable it when needed.
