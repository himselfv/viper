# Windows Error Reporting Service
Gives users the opportunity to send data about errors to Microsoft when programs stop working or responding, and to receive information about solutions. It also generates logs for the Problem Reports and Solutions diagnostic and repair service.

Solutions can include instructions for working around a problem, or links to updated drivers, patches, or Microsoft Knowledge Base articles.

Data to send and excluded applications can be configured by the administrator. See Problem Reporting settings page, or Group Policy under Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Error Reporting\Consent.
