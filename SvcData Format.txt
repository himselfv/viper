Description file format:

All information should be in English.

Each service must have at most one description file (.txt). If it's filed under several folders, the remaining folders must contain empty .lnk files with the same name.

By default the information is valid for all versions of the OS where the service is present. Version-dependent comments are planned, not standardized at the moment.

# Comments can be used to store additional information which will not be visible in the UI.
# It's a good idea to have English-language display name and description as a comment for services with dubious names.

Special notes in the file:

TITLE:[Title]
Overrides display title for the service (useful for services with totally non-descriptive titles). Do not abuse. %1 is replaced with original title (to preserve localized titles).

CRITICAL
CRITICAL:[Explanation]
This service is required for a core system functionality to work. If you disable it, you will not be able to boot/log on/run most applications.
[Explanation] may explain the consequences of disabling. There can be several CRITICAL entries.

REQUIRES:[ServiceName,...]
Additional dependencies for this service. May also list dependencies already specified by the OS.

RELATED:[ServiceName,...]

TELEMETRY

Things to note in comments:
- Manual mode behavior: Will the service autostart when its functionality is needed or will it have to be started manually?
- Disabled mode impact: Will disabling the service break anything?
- Always runs anyway: Will this service always run anyway when in Manual? (e.g. ShellHWDetection) What triggers this? (for ShellHWDetection: Explorer).
- Autostop behavior: Will the service stop after a while idle?
- Reenabling behavior: Will the service be automatically reenabled if disabled? By what?
