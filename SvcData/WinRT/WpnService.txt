# Windows Push Notifications System Service
# This service runs in session 0 and hosts the notification platform and connection provider which handles the connection between the device and WNS server.
Push notifications let the web services notify the users of events without maintaining a separate network connection each. Subscriber PCs register in WNS network and maintain a connection to it. Web services send event notifications to WNS which pushes these to subscribers.
