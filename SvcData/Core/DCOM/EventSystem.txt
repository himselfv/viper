# COM+ Event System
# Supports System Event Notification Service (SENS), which provides automatic distribution of events to subscribing Component Object Model (COM) components. If the service is stopped, SENS will close and will not be able to provide logon and logoff notifications. If this service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on it will fail to start.
TITLE: SENS\%1
CRITICAL: Required by SENS, which is needed for logon.
