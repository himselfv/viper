# Microsoft Software Shadow Copy Provider
Manages software-based volume shadow copies taken by the Volume Shadow Copy service. See VSS service for the description of Shadow Copies.

There are two classes of shadow copies:

* A hardware copy is a mirror of the volume on a separate device which can be unmounted.

* A software shadow copy uses a copy-on-write scheme to copy all sectors of a volume that change over time into a differential area on disk.
