# Windows Time
# Maintains date and time synchronization on all clients and servers in the network.

The service itself is not required, but time must be kept synchronized finely enough because the following depends on it:
* Cryptography (various handshakes)
* Domain authentication
* HTTPS / SSL / TLS / Secure connections

Can be set to manual.
