# Remote Access Connection Manager
The Remote Access Connection Manager (RasMan) service manages dial-up and VPN connections from your computer to the Internet or other remote networks. When you double-click a connection in the Network Connections folder and then click the Connect button, the Remote Access Connection Manager service either dials the connection or sends a VPN connection request and handles subsequent negotiations with the remote access server to set up the connection.

The Remote Access Connection Manager service unloads itself when no requests are pending.
