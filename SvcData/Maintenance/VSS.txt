# Volume Shadow Copy
Implements volume shadow copies, which are used for backup and other purposes, and manages the volume snapshots.

A shadow copy is a snapshot copy of a disk volume that represents a consistent read-only point in time for that volume. This snapshot then stays constant and allows an application, such as backup software, to copy data from the shadow copy to tape.

Needed for Backup and Restore, System Restore points and for any third-party backup solutions which use it.
