# Block Level Backup Engine Service
Performs block level backup and recovery of data. Used by Windows Backup to perform backup and recovery operations.

The service allows for backups to occur at the hard disk level, instead of just file by file, in a process similar to disk imaging.

Manual by default and okay to keep so.
