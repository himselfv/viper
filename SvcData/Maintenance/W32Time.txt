# Windows Time
# Maintains date and time synchronization on all clients and servers in the network.
On a workstation, synchronizes time with external sources. On a domain controller, also provides time to domain participants.

Set to manual and can be kept manual.

Synchronization itself is optional, but the following requires computer clock to be precise enough:
* Cryptography (various handshakes)
* Domain authentication
* HTTPS / SSL / TLS / Secure connections
