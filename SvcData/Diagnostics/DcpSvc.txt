TELEMETRY
Seems to be related to Windows Phone and "crowdsourcing", telemetry. Contains URLs below.

In dcpsvc.dll:
> Windows Phone Crowdsourcing Data Loader
> X-WPS-Partner-StatusCode, X-WPS-DeviceID:, X-WPS-Partner-StatusMessage, Content-Encoding: gzip, X-WPS-LiveID:, X-WPS-Crowdsource
> https://dcpservice.windowsphone.com
> https://dcp-pn.dcpservice.windowsphone-int.com/
> dcp.windowsphone.net
> PhoneMobileOperatorName,
> Microsoft.Windows.Telemetry.DataCollectionAndPublish
> Microsoft-Windows-DataCollectionServiceChannel

Seems to have been called "CrowdsourcingService" before, as all function names start with that.

Probably better off disabled and/or deleted. Looks like a remnant from something deprecated.
