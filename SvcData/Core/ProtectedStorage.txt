Provides protected storage for sensitive data, such as passwords, to prevent access by unauthorized services, processes, or users.

Not to be confused with VaultSvc. Seems to be unrelated to saved passwords from "Manage your credentials" (see VaultSvc for that).

-Windows 10: Deprecated in Windows 10.

> Protected Storage service was deprecated and made read-only in Vista and removed in Windows 8. It was not very secure.
> The replacement to be used by app developers is a more secure API like the Windows Data Protection API. IE, EFS, CredMan, EFS all use that.

> The Protected Storage service protects storage of sensitive information, such as private keys, and prevents access by unauthorized services, processes, or users. The service provides a set of software libraries that allow applications to retrieve security and other information from personal storage locations as it hides the implementation and details of the storage itself.
> The storage location that is provided by this service is protected from modification. The Protected Storage service uses the Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) and the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1) cryptographic hash function to encrypt the user's master key. This component requires no configuration.
> If the Protected Storage service stops, private keys are inaccessible, the Certificate Services service does not operate, Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) and SSL do not work, and smart card logon fails.
