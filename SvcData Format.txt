Description file format:

All information should be in English at the moment.

Each service must have at most one description file at the moment. Multi-filing is not supported for a variety of reasons.

By default the information is valid for all versions of the OS where the service is present. Version-dependent comments are in developement, not standardized at the moment.

# Comments
# Use to store additional information which is nice to have around,
# but not required in the UI.

# It's a good idea to have English-language display name and description # in the first two comment lines of the file.

Special notes in the file:

TITLE: Overrides display title for the service (useful for services with totally non-descriptive titles). Do not abuse. %1 is replaced with original title (to preserve localized titles).

CRITICAL: This service is required for a core system functionality to work. If you disable it, you will not be able to boot/log on/run most applications.
CRITICAL: Description may explains the consequences of disabling. There may be several CRITICAL entries.

REQUIRES: Additional requirements for this service when they are not specified in the OS dependencies.
RELATED: Lists related services, comma-separated.

TELEMETRY: This service phones home.

What to note:
- Does Manual mode break anything or will it properly run when needed?
- Does Disabled mode break anything?
- Does it always run anyway when in Manual mode? (E.g. ShellHWDetection). Under which conditions? (E.g. Explorer starts some, others autorun under more basic conditions)
- Does it auto-reenable itself when disabled? Does something else (e.g. a task, another system component) reenable it?
- Does it indeed auto-shutdown after completing its work? (There are such nice services)
